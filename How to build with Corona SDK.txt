	C:\>adb install -r C:\Users\Paul\Documents\CoronaBuilds\Android\nexBus.apk
7. This will install the app on the phone (so long as you have set permission on the phone to load apps from unknown sources [ie not the Google Play Store])
8. Note the full set of icons Corona expects for an Android app!
9. In adb, the command 'adb devices' can be used to confirm the phone-usb-pc channel is open
